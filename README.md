# Organiziha - DQN Model for ADHD Task Planning

This repository contains the Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning model developed for the **Organiziha** application, an AI-based assistant designed to help adults with ADHD plan, organize, and manage daily tasks more efficiently.

## 📋 Project Description

People with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often face difficulties in planning, prioritizing, and completing tasks.  
Organiziha uses artificial intelligence, particularly a reinforcement learning model (DQN), to personalize task management support for each user based on their habits, preferences, and feedback.

The DQN model adapts dynamically, learning over time which notifications and suggestions are most effective for keeping users organized.

## 🧠 Algorithm Details

- **State Variables**: noise level, deadline proximity, task priority, time of day, task duration, device usage.
- **Action Space**: Notify the user or do not notify.
- **Learning**: Model improves through user feedback (reward-based learning).
- **Framework**: TensorFlow, Keras.

## 📁 Files

- `ORGANIZIHA algorithm DQN Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the DQN model.

## 🚀 Future Integration

The model is planned to be integrated into the **Organiziha** mobile application (developed using Flutter) to optimize task notification strategies and support users in their daily organization.

## 📚 More Information

This model is part of the final year project "**Adapting planning for adult ADHD**" (Kasdi Merbah Ouargla University, 2023/2024).
